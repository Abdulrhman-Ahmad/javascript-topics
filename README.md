# Core Features of JavaScript

JavaScript is a versatile programming language with several core features that make it powerful for web development and beyond.

## Data Types and Typing

- **Dynamic Typing**: JavaScript is dynamically typed, allowing variables to change types at runtime.

## Object-Oriented Programming

- **Prototype-based Inheritance**: Objects can inherit properties and methods directly from other objects.
- **Functions as First-Class Objects**: Functions can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from functions.

## Event Handling and Asynchronous Programming

- **Event-Driven**: JavaScript is event-driven, enabling the registration of event handlers to respond to user actions and other events.
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Supports asynchronous programming through features like callbacks, promises, and async/await.

## Functional Programming Support

- **Functional Programming Paradigms**: JavaScript supports functional programming, allowing for the use of higher-order functions like map, reduce, and filter.

## Language Features

- **Closures**: JavaScript supports closures, enabling functions to maintain access to variables from their lexical scope.
- **Dynamic Objects**: Objects can be dynamically modified at runtime, facilitating the creation of flexible data structures.
- **Garbage Collection**: Automatic garbage collection manages memory, eliminating the need for explicit memory management.

## Cross-Platform Compatibility

- **Versatile Deployment**: JavaScript runs on various platforms and devices, making it suitable for web development, server-side scripting (Node.js), and mobile app development (React Native).

These core features collectively contribute to making JavaScript a powerful and flexible language for building interactive and dynamic applications.
